                I was introduced to software development when I was 12; I built
                my own version of Facebook with HTML and CSS. While Fakebook
                <sup style={{ fontSize: 10 }}>TM</sup> never took off, I
                discovered my interest in technology and formally learnt how to
                code through high school.
